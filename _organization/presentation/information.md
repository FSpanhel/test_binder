@all Upfront, some information about the presentation that will take place on January 20th.
The presentation of your project should be based on the Git commit history and GitLab issues and merge requests. That is, show (essential) Git commits and GitLab isses/merge requests in the presentation and use them to present the evolution (discussions, decisions, merge requests) of your project.
To explain decisions, e.g., we use feature X but not feature Z, that are not obvious from merge requests or issues, you should use notebooks or snapshots from notebooks.
During the presentation, it should become clear to everyone how the package and the scripts work and what they do.
For instance,



      What features do you create and how is the training done?


      How do you predict?


      How can the workflow of the script be changed? In particular, the time range for training and prediction.

The team member roles and their responsibilites (who did what) should also become clear during the presentation.
Moreover, you will be presenting the mean absolute error of the forecast for a particular time period. More details will follow.
