# - In this chapter we will discuss how to setup a Python project
# - A Python project consists of three parts
#     - A virtual environment
#     - A folder structure (including how to modularize code into modules)
#     - A Git repository (which has been discussed in the previous chapter)
# - We will first uncover what a virtual environment actually is and why you must use them.
# - Moreover, we address how to manage packages and environments with conda.
# - After knowing how to use Git and virtual environments, we will consider how a sound folder structure of your project should look like.
# - In this regard, we will talk about when to use Jupyter notebooks and when to modularize your code into modules or a package.
