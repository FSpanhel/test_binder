    "- In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of **finding and resolving bugs** (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.\n",
    "- Debugging tactics can involve **interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis**, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling. \n",
    "- Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as **debuggers**."

    "    - Not applicable for more complex tasks and when it is cumbersome to separate code into steps (e.g., functions, classes)\n",
