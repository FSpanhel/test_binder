    "- Placing all your packages in the same folder as your global Python installation results in the following **issues**\n",
    "    - Your packages can **mix with system-relevant packages** that operating systems such as Linux or macOS use, resulting in unexpected side effects on your operating system’s normal behavior.\n",
    "    - Your packages might get overwritten and lost if you update your OS.\n",
    "    - You can only use **one version of a package**. \n",
    "        - Quite frequently, projects require different package versions. \n",
    "        - You have to overwrite the package by its required version whenever you switch projects.\n",
    "    - You might run into a **dependency conflict** when you want to install a new package.\n",
    "        - Package A might require package B v1.3. But the new package C might require package B v.1.0.\n",
    "    - It is **difficult to know what project requires which packages**.\n",
    "    - The previous three points make it **practically impossible to collaborate with others**. \n",

    "    - Provided you use a virtual environment for each separate project\n",
    "        - You can make your project self-contained and reproducible by capturing all package in a environment file.\n",

    "    - Is **a folder** structure that mimics the structue of a global Python installation.\n",

    "- For convenience, **its activation script modifies the PATH variable** so that applications look for the executables of the environment when a command is run.\n",
    "- With this change you don't need to provide the absolute paths of executables but can only type ```pip``` or ```python``` to run the respective programs of the virtual environment (provided the programs have been installed into the environment).\n",
    "- If you don't use virtual environments you can run into several problems.\n",
